# house-price-scraper

Some simple web scraping to pick up property price estimates from Zoopla. This can be used to give you an indication of the value of any properties you own in the UK. 

Add a config.ini file with the following structure:

```
[main]
urls=["zoopla URL 1", "zoopla URL 2"]
```

Include 1 url for each property you're looking to get price estimates for.
